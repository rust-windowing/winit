# Hall of Champions

The winit maintainers would like to recognize the following former winit
contributors, without whom winit would not exist in its current form. We thank
them deeply for their time and efforts, and wish them best of luck in their
future endeavors:

* [@tomaka]: For creating the winit project and guiding it through its early
  years of existence.
* [@vberger]: For diligently creating the Wayland backend, and being its
  extremely helpful and benevolent maintainer for years.
* [@francesca64]: For taking over the responsibility of maintaining almost every
  winit backend, and standardizing HiDPI support across all of them.
* [@Osspial]: For heroically landing EventLoop 2.0, and valiantly ushering in a
  vastly more sustainable era of winit.
* [@goddessfreya]: For selflessly taking over maintainership of glutin, and her
  stellar dedication to improving both winit and glutin.
