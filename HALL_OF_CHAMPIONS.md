# Hall of Champions

The Winit maintainers would like to recognize the following former Winit
contributors, without whom Winit would not exist in its current form. We thank
them deeply for their time and efforts, and wish them best of luck in their
future endeavors:

* [@tomaka]: For creating the Winit project and guiding it through its early
  years of existence.
* [@francesca64]: For taking over the responsibility of maintaining almost every
  Winit backend, and standardizing HiDPI support across all of them
