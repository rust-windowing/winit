//! Various utilities for interfacing with the main run loop.

//! These allow for using closures without the `Send + Sync` requirement that is otherwise required

    /// # Implementation
    ///
    /// This queuing could be implemented in the following several ways with subtle differences in
    /// timing. This list is sorted in rough order in which they are run:
    ///
    /// 1. Using `CFRunLoopPerformBlock` or `-[NSRunLoop performBlock:]`.
    ///
    /// 2. Using `-[NSObject performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:]` or wrapping the
    ///    event in `NSEvent` and posting that to `-[NSApplication postEvent:atStart:]` (both
    ///    creates a custom `CFRunLoopSource`, and signals that to wake up the main event loop).
    ///
    ///    a. `atStart = true`.
    ///
    ///    b. `atStart = false`.
    ///
    /// 3. `dispatch_async` or `dispatch_async_f`. Note that this may appear before 2b, it does not
    ///    respect the ordering that runloop events have.
    ///
    /// We choose the first one, both for ease-of-implementation, but mostly for consistency, as we
    /// want the event to be queued in a way that preserves the order the events originally arrived
    /// in.
    ///
    /// As an example, let's assume that we receive two events from the user, a mouse click which we
    /// handled by queuing it, and a window resize which we handled immediately. If we allowed
    /// AppKit to choose the ordering when queuing the mouse event, it might get put in the back of
    /// the queue, and the events would appear out of order to the user of Winit. So we must instead
    /// put the event at the very front of the queue, to be handled as soon as possible after
    /// handling whatever event it's currently handling.
