//! # OpenHarmony
//!
//! The OpenHarmony backend builds on (and exposes types from) the [`ohos-rs`](https://docs.rs/ohos-rs/) crate.
//!
//! Native OpenHarmony applications need some form of "glue" crate that is responsible
//! for defining the main entry point for your Rust application as well as tracking
//! various life-cycle events and synchronizing with the main thread.
//!
//! Winit uses the [openharmony-ability](https://docs.rs/openharmony-ability/) as a
//! glue crate.
//!
