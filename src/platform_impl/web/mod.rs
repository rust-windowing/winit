// Brief introduction to the internals of the web backend:
// The web backend used to support both wasm-bindgen and stdweb as methods of binding to the
// environment. Because they are both supporting the same underlying APIs, the actual web bindings
// are cordoned off into backend abstractions, which present the thinnest unifying layer possible.
//
// When adding support for new events or interactions with the browser, first consult trusted
// documentation (such as MDN) to ensure it is well-standardised and supported across many browsers.
// Once you have decided on the relevant web APIs, add support to both backends.
//
// The backend is used by the rest of the module to implement Winit's business logic, which forms
// the rest of the code. 'device', 'error', 'monitor', and 'window' define web-specific structures
// for winit's cross-platform structures. They are all relatively simple translations.
//
// The event_loop module handles listening for and processing events. 'Proxy' implements
// EventLoopProxy and 'WindowTarget' implements EventLoopWindowTarget. WindowTarget also handles
// registering the event handlers. The 'Execution' struct in the 'runner' module handles taking
// incoming events (from the registered handlers) and ensuring they are passed to the user in a
// compliant way.
