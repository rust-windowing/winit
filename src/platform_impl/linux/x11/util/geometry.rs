            //   using a screenshot tool to get a screenshot of a selected window, and is
            //   presumably used for drawing drop shadows. Getting window geometry information
            //   via hierarchy-climbing results in this margin being included in both the
            //   position and outer size, so a window positioned at (0, 0) would be reported as
            //   having a position (-10, -8).
            // * Compiz has a drop shadow margin just like Mutter/Muffin/Budgie, though it's 10px
            //   on all sides, and there's no additional border.
            // * Enlightenment otherwise gets a y position equivalent to inner_y_rel_root.
            //   Without decorations, there's no difference. This is presumably related to
            //   Enlightenment's fairly unique concept of window position; it interprets
            //   positions given to XMoveWindow as a client area position rather than a position
