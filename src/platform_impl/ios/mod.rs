//! iOS support
//!
//! # Building app
//! To build ios app you will need rustc built for this targets:
//!
//!  - armv7-apple-ios
//!  - armv7s-apple-ios
//!  - i386-apple-ios
//!  - aarch64-apple-ios
//!  - x86_64-apple-ios
//!
//! Then
//!
//! ```
//! cargo build --target=...
//! ```
//! The simplest way to integrate your app into xcode environment is to build it
//! as a static library. Wrap your main function and export it.
//!
//! ```rust, ignore
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern fn start_winit_app() {
//!     start_inner()
//! }
//!
//! fn start_inner() {
//!    ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Compile project and then drag resulting .a into Xcode project. Add winit.h to xcode.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! void start_winit_app();
//! ```
//!
//! Use start_winit_app inside your xcode's main function.
//!
//!
//! # App lifecycle and events
//!
//! iOS environment is very different from other platforms and you must be very
//! careful with it's events. Familiarize yourself with
//! [app lifecycle](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/).
//!
//!
//! This is how those event are represented in winit:
//!
//!  - applicationDidBecomeActive is Resumed
//!  - applicationWillResignActive is Suspended
//!  - applicationWillTerminate is LoopExiting
//!
//! Keep in mind that after LoopExiting event is received every attempt to draw with
//! opengl will result in segfault.
//!
//! Also note that app may not receive the LoopExiting event if suspended; it might be SIGKILL'ed.
