//! DPI is important, so read the docs for this module if you don't want to be confused.
//!
//! Originally, `winit` dealt entirely in physical pixels (excluding unintentional inconsistencies), but now all
//! window-related functions both produce and consume logical pixels. Monitor-related functions still use physical
//! pixels, as do any context-related functions in `glutin`.
//!
//! If you've never heard of these terms before, then you're not alone, and this documentation will explain the
//! concepts.
//!
//! Modern screens have a defined physical resolution, most commonly 1920x1080. Indepedent of that is the amount of
//! space the screen occupies, which is to say, the height and width in millimeters. The relationship between these two
//! measurements is the *pixel density*. Mobile screens require a high pixel density, as they're held close to the
//! eyes. Larger displays also require a higher pixel density, hence the growing presence of 1440p and 4K displays.
//!
//! So, this presents a problem. Let's say we want to render a square 100px button. It will occupy 100x100 of the
//! screen's pixels, which in many cases, seems perfectly fine. However, because this size doesn't account for the
//! screen's dimensions or pixel density, the button's size can vary quite a bit. On a 4K display, it would be unusably
//! small.
//!
//! That's a description of what happens when the button is 100x100 *physical* pixels. Instead, let's try using 100x100
//! *logical* pixels. To map logical pixels to physical pixels, we simply multiply by the DPI (dots per inch) factor.
//! On a "typical" desktop display, the DPI factor will be 1.0, so 100x100 logical pixels equates to 100x100 physical
//! pixels. However, a 1440p display may have a DPI factor of 1.25, so the button is rendered as 125x125 physical pixels.
//! Ideally, the button now has approximately the same perceived size across varying displays.
//!
//! Failure to account for the DPI factor can create a badly degraded user experience. Most notably, it can make users
//! feel like they have bad eyesight, which will potentially cause them to think about growing elderly, resulting in
//! them entering an existential panic. Once users enter that state, they will no longer be focused on your application.
//!
//! There are two ways to get the DPI factor:
//! - You can track the [`HiDpiFactorChanged`](../enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.HiDpiFactorChanged) event of your
//!   windows. This event is sent any time the DPI factor changes, either because the window moved to another monitor,
//!   or because the user changed the configuration of their screen.
//! - You can also retrieve the DPI factor of a monitor by calling
//!   [`MonitorHandle::hidpi_factor`](../monitor/struct.MonitorHandle.html#method.hidpi_factor), or the
//!   current DPI factor applied to a window by calling
//!   [`Window::hidpi_factor`](../window/struct.Window.html#method.hidpi_factor), which is roughly equivalent
//!   to `window.current_monitor().hidpi_factor()`.
//!
//! Depending on the platform, the window's actual DPI factor may only be known after
//! the event loop has started and your window has been drawn once. To properly handle these cases,
//! the most robust way is to monitor the [`HiDpiFactorChanged`](../enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.HiDpiFactorChanged)
//! event and dynamically adapt your drawing logic to follow the DPI factor.
//!
//! Here's an overview of what sort of DPI factors you can expect, and where they come from:
//! - **Windows:** On Windows 8 and 10, per-monitor scaling is readily configured by users from the display settings.
//! While users are free to select any option they want, they're only given a selection of "nice" DPI factors, i.e.
//! 1.0, 1.25, 1.5... on Windows 7, the DPI factor is global and changing it requires logging out.
//! - **macOS:** The buzzword is "retina displays", which have a DPI factor of 2.0. Otherwise, the DPI factor is 1.0.
//! Intermediate DPI factors are never used, thus 1440p displays/etc. aren't properly supported. It's possible for any
//! display to use that 2.0 DPI factor, given the use of the command line.
//! - **X11:** On X11, we calcuate the DPI factor based on the millimeter dimensions provided by XRandR. This can
//! result in a wide range of possible values, including some interesting ones like 1.0833333333333333. This can be
//! overridden using the `WINIT_HIDPI_FACTOR` environment variable, though that's not recommended.
//! - **Wayland:** On Wayland, DPI factors are set per-screen by the server, and are always integers (most often 1 or 2).
//! - **iOS:** DPI factors are both constant and device-specific on iOS.
//! - **Android:** This feature isn't yet implemented on Android, so the DPI factor will always be returned as 1.0.
//! - **Web:** DPI factors are handled by the browser and will always be 1.0 for your application.
//!
//! The window's logical size is conserved across DPI changes, resulting in the physical size changing instead. This
//! may be surprising on X11, but is quite standard elsewhere. Physical size changes always produce a
//! [`Resized`](../event/enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.Resized) event, even on platforms where no resize actually occurs,
//! such as macOS and Wayland. As a result, it's not necessary to separately handle
//! [`HiDpiFactorChanged`](../event/enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.HiDpiFactorChanged) if you're only listening for size.
//!
//! Your GPU has no awareness of the concept of logical pixels, and unless you like wasting pixel density, your
//! framebuffer's size should be in physical pixels.
//!
//! `winit` will send [`Resized`](../enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.Resized) events whenever a window's logical size
//! changes, and [`HiDpiFactorChanged`](../enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.HiDpiFactorChanged) events
//! whenever the DPI factor changes. Receiving either of these events means that the physical size of your window has
//! changed, and you should recompute it using the latest values you received for each. If the logical size and the
//! DPI factor change simultaneously, `winit` will send both events together; thus, it's recommended to buffer
//! these events and process them at the end of the queue.
//!
//! If you never received any [`HiDpiFactorChanged`](../enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.HiDpiFactorChanged) events,
//! then your window's DPI factor is 1.
