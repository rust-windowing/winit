    ///   factor is global and changing it requires logging out. See [this article][windows_1] for
    ///   technical details.

    ///   displays. When available, the user may pick a per-monitor scaling factor from a set of
    ///   pre-defined settings. All "retina displays" have a scaling factor above 1.0 by default,
    ///   but the specific value varies across devices.
    /// - **X11:** Many man-hours have been spent trying to figure out how to handle DPI in X11.
    ///   Winit currently uses a three-pronged approach:
    ///   + Use the value in the `WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR` environment variable if present.
    ///   + If not present, use the value set in `Xft.dpi` in Xresources.
    ///   + Otherwise, calculate the scale factor based on the millimeter monitor dimensions
    ///     provided by XRandR.
    ///
    ///   If `WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR` is set to `randr`, it'll ignore the `Xft.dpi` field and use
    ///   the   XRandR scaling method. Generally speaking, you should try to configure the
    ///   standard system   variables to do what you want before resorting to
    ///   `WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR`.
    /// - **Wayland:** The scale factor is suggested by the compositor for each window individually
    ///   by using the wp-fractional-scale protocol if available. Falls back to integer-scale
    ///   factors otherwise.
    ///
    ///   The monitor scale factor may differ from the window scale factor.
    /// - **iOS:** Scale factors are set by Apple to the value that best suits the device, and range
    ///   from `1.0` to `3.0`. See [this article][apple_1] and [this article][apple_2] for more
    ///   information.
    ///

    ///
    ///   This is currently unimplemented, and this function always returns 1.0.
    /// - **Web:** The scale factor is the ratio between CSS pixels and the physical device pixels.
    ///   In other words, it is the value of [`window.devicePixelRatio`][web_1]. It is affected by
