//! Winit is a cross-platform window creation and event loop management library.
//!
//! # Building windows
//!
//! Before you can create a [`Window`], you first need to build an [`EventLoop`]. This is done with
//! the [`EventLoop::new()`] function.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winit::event_loop::EventLoop;
//! let event_loop = EventLoop::new().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Then you create a [`Window`] with [`create_window`].
//!
//! # Event handling
//!
//! Once a [`Window`] has been created, it will generate different *events*. A [`Window`] object can
//! generate [`WindowEvent`]s when certain input events occur, such as a cursor moving over the
//! window or a key getting pressed while the window is focused. Devices can generate
//! [`DeviceEvent`]s, which contain unfiltered event data that isn't specific to a certain window.
//! Some user activity, like mouse movement, can generate both a [`WindowEvent`] *and* a
//! [`DeviceEvent`]. You can also create and handle your own custom [`Event::UserEvent`]s, if desired.
//!
//! You can retrieve events by calling [`EventLoop::run()`]. This function will
//! dispatch events for every [`Window`] that was created with that particular [`EventLoop`], and
//! will run until [`exit()`] is used, at which point [`Event::LoopExiting`].
//!
//! Winit no longer uses a `EventLoop::poll_events() -> impl Iterator<Event>`-based event loop
//! model, since that can't be implemented properly on some platforms (e.g web, iOS) and works poorly on
//! most other platforms. However, this model can be re-implemented to an extent with
#![cfg_attr(
    any(
        windows_platform,
        macos_platform,
        android_platform,
        x11_platform,
        wayland_platform
    ),
    doc = "[`EventLoopExtPumpEvents::pump_events()`][platform::pump_events::EventLoopExtPumpEvents::pump_events()]"
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    not(any(
        windows_platform,
        macos_platform,
        android_platform,

        wayland_platform
    )),
    doc = "`EventLoopExtPumpEvents::pump_events()`"
)]
//! [^1]. See that method's documentation for more reasons about why
//! it's discouraged beyond compatibility reasons.
//!
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winit::{
//!     event::{Event, WindowEvent},
//!     event_loop::{ControlFlow, EventLoop},
//!     window::Window,
//! };
//!
//! let event_loop = EventLoop::new().unwrap();
//!
//! // ControlFlow::Poll continuously runs the event loop, even if the OS hasn't
//! // dispatched any events. This is ideal for games and similar applications.
//! event_loop.set_control_flow(ControlFlow::Poll);
//!
//! // ControlFlow::Wait pauses the event loop if no events are available to process.
//! // This is ideal for non-game applications that only update in response to user
//! // input, and uses significantly less power/CPU time than ControlFlow::Poll.
//! event_loop.set_control_flow(ControlFlow::Wait);
//!
//! let mut window = None;
//!
//! event_loop.run(move |event, event_loop| {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::Resumed => {
//!             window = Some(event_loop.create_window(Window::default_attributes()).unwrap());
//!         }
//!         Event::WindowEvent {
//!             event: WindowEvent::CloseRequested,
//!             ..
//!         } => {
//!             println!("The close button was pressed; stopping");
//!             event_loop.exit();
//!         },
//!         Event::AboutToWait => {
//!             // Application update code.
//!
//!             // Queue a RedrawRequested event.
//!             //
//!             // You only need to call this if you've determined that you need to redraw in
//!             // applications which do not always need to. Applications that redraw continuously
//!             // can render here instead.
//!             window.as_ref().unwrap().request_redraw();
//!         },
//!         Event::WindowEvent {
//!             event: WindowEvent::RedrawRequested,
//!             ..
//!         } => {
//!             // Redraw the application.
//!             //
//!             // It's preferable for applications that do not render continuously to render in
//!             // this event rather than in AboutToWait, since rendering in here allows
//!             // the program to gracefully handle redraws requested by the OS.
//!         },
//!         _ => ()
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! [`WindowEvent`] has a [`WindowId`] member. In multi-window environments, it should be
//! compared to the value returned by [`Window::id()`] to determine which [`Window`]
//! dispatched the event.
//!
//! # Drawing on the window
//!
//! Winit doesn't directly provide any methods for drawing on a [`Window`]. However, it allows you to
//! retrieve the raw handle of the window and display (see the [`platform`] module and/or the
//! [`raw_window_handle`] and [`raw_display_handle`] methods), which in turn allows
//! you to create an OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX/Metal/etc. context that can be used to render graphics.
//!
//! Note that many platforms will display garbage data in the window's client area if the
//! application doesn't render anything to the window by the time the desktop compositor is ready to
//! display the window to the user. If you notice this happening, you should create the window with
//! [`visible` set to `false`](crate::window::WindowAttributes::with_visible) and explicitly make the
//! window visible only once you're ready to render into it.
//!
//! # UI scaling
//!
//! UI scaling is important, go read the docs for the [`dpi`] crate for an
//! introduction.
//!
//! All of Winit's functions return physical types, but can take either logical or physical
//! coordinates as input, allowing you to use the most convenient coordinate system for your
//! particular application.
//!
//! Winit will dispatch a [`ScaleFactorChanged`] event whenever a window's scale factor has changed.
//! This can happen if the user drags their window from a standard-resolution monitor to a high-DPI
//! monitor or if the user changes their DPI settings. This allows you to rescale your application's
//! UI elements and adjust how the platform changes the window's size to reflect the new scale
//! factor. If a window hasn't received a [`ScaleFactorChanged`] event, its scale factor
//! can be found by calling [`window.scale_factor()`].
//!
//! [`ScaleFactorChanged`]: event::WindowEvent::ScaleFactorChanged
//! [`window.scale_factor()`]: window::Window::scale_factor
//!
