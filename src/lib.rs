//! Winit allows you to build a window on as many platforms as possible.
//!
//! # Building a window
//!
//! Before you can build a window, you first need to build an `EventLoop`. This is done with the
//! `EventLoop::new()` function. Example:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winit::event_loop::EventLoop;
//! let events_loop = EventLoop::new();
//! ```
//!
//! Once this is done there are two ways to create a window:
//!
//!  - Calling `Window::new(&events_loop)`.
//!  - Calling `let builder = WindowBuilder::new()` then `builder.build(&events_loop)`.
//!
//! The first way is the simplest way and will give you default values for everything.
//!
//! The second way allows you to customize the way your window will look and behave by modifying
//! the fields of the `WindowBuilder` object before you create the window.
//!
//! # Events handling
//!
//! Once a window has been created, it will *generate events*. For example whenever the user moves
//! the window, resizes the window, moves the mouse, etc. an event is generated.
//!
//! The events generated by a window can be retreived from the `EventLoop` the window was created
//! with.
//!
//! You do this by calling `events_loop.run(...)`. This function will run forever unless it is
//! stopped by returning `ControlFlow::Exit`, at which point the entire program will terminate.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winit::event_loop::ControlFlow;
//! use winit::event::{Event, WindowEvent};
//! # use winit::event_loop::EventLoop;
//! # let events_loop = EventLoop::new();
//!
//! events_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::WindowEvent { event: WindowEvent::CloseRequested, .. } => {
//!             println!("The close button was pressed; stopping");
//!             *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit
//!         },
//!         _ => *control_flow = ControlFlow::Wait,
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! If you use multiple windows, the `WindowEvent` event has a member named `window_id`. You can
//! compare it with the value returned by the `id()` method of `Window` in order to know which
//! window has received the event.
//!
//! # Drawing on the window
//!
//! Winit doesn't provide any function that allows drawing on a window. However it allows you to
//! retrieve the raw handle of the window (see the `platform` module for that), which in turn allows you
//! to create an OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX/Metal/etc. context that will draw on the window.
