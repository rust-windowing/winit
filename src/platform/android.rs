//! # Android
//!
//! The Android backend builds on (and exposes types from) the [`ndk`](https://docs.rs/ndk/) crate.
//!
//! Native Android applications need some form of "glue" crate that is responsible
//! for defining the main entry point for your Rust application as well as tracking
//! various life-cycle events and synchronizing with the main JVM thread.
//!
//! Winit uses the [android-activity](https://docs.rs/android-activity/) as a
//! glue crate (prior to `0.28` it used
//! [ndk-glue](https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-ndk-rs/tree/master/ndk-glue)).
//!
//! The version of the glue crate that your application depends on _must_ match the
//! version that Winit depends on because the glue crate is responsible for your
//! application's main entry point. If Cargo resolves multiple versions, they will
//! clash.
//!
//! `winit` glue compatibility table:
//!
//! | winit |       ndk-glue               |
//! | :---: | :--------------------------: |
//! | 0.29  | `android-activity = "0.5"`   |
//! | 0.28  | `android-activity = "0.4"`   |
//! | 0.27  | `ndk-glue = "0.7"`           |
//! | 0.26  | `ndk-glue = "0.5"`           |
//! | 0.25  | `ndk-glue = "0.3"`           |
//! | 0.24  | `ndk-glue = "0.2"`           |
//!
//! The recommended way to avoid a conflict with the glue version is to avoid explicitly
//! depending on the `android-activity` crate, and instead consume the API that
//! is re-exported by Winit under `winit::platform::android::activity::*`
//!
//! Running on an Android device needs a dynamic system library. Add this to Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! name = "main"
//! crate-type = ["cdylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! All Android applications are based on an `Activity` subclass, and the
//! `android-activity` crate is designed to support different choices for this base
//! class. Your application _must_ specify the base class it needs via a feature flag:
//!
//! | Base Class       | Feature Flag      |  Notes  |
//! | :--------------: | :---------------: | :-----: |
//! | `NativeActivity` | `android-native-activity` | Built-in to Android - it is possible to use without compiling any Java or Kotlin code. Java or Kotlin code may be needed to subclass `NativeActivity` to access some platform features. It does not derive from the [`AndroidAppCompat`] base class.|
//! | [`GameActivity`] | `android-game-activity`   | Derives from [`AndroidAppCompat`], a defacto standard `Activity` base class that helps support a wider range of Android versions. Requires a build system that can compile Java or Kotlin and fetch Android dependencies from a [Maven repository][agdk_jetpack] (or link with an embedded [release][agdk_releases] of [`GameActivity`]) |

//!
//! ## Converting from `ndk-glue` to `android-activity`
//!
//! If your application is currently based on `NativeActivity` via the `ndk-glue` crate and building with `cargo apk`, then the minimal changes would be:
//! 1. Remove `ndk-glue` from your `Cargo.toml`
//! 2. Enable the `"android-native-activity"` feature for Winit: `winit = { version = "0.29.10", features = [ "android-native-activity" ] }`
//! 3. Add an `android_main` entrypoint (as above), instead of using the '`[ndk_glue::main]` proc macro from `ndk-macros` (optionally add a dependency on `android_logger` and initialize logging as above).
//! 4. Pass a clone of the `AndroidApp` that your application receives to Winit when building your event loop (as shown above).
