/// application crate.
///

/// of the `android_activity` glue crate linked with an application because
/// it is responsible for the application's `android_main()` entry point.

/// way to avoid creating a conflict is for applications to avoid explicitly
/// depending on the `android_activity` crate, and instead consume the API that
/// is re-exported by Winit.
///
/// For compatibility applications should then import the `AndroidApp` type for
/// their `android_main(app: AndroidApp)` function like:
/// ```rust
/// #[cfg(target_os="android")]
/// use winit::platform::android::activity::AndroidApp;
