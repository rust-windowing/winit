    /// Despite its apperance at first glance, this is *not* a perfect replacement for
    /// `poll_events`. For example, this function will not return on Windows or macOS while a
    /// window is getting resized, resulting in all application logic outside of the
    /// `event_handler` closure not running until the resize operation ends. Other OS operations
    /// may also result in such freezes. This behavior is caused by fundamental limitations in the
    /// underyling OS APIs, which cannot be hidden by Winit without severe stability reprecussions.
    ///
    /// You are strongly encouraged to use `run`, unless the use of this is absolutely necessary.
