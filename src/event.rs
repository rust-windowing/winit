//! The [`Event`] enum and assorted supporting types.
//!
//! These are sent to the closure given to [`EventLoop::run(...)`], where they get
//! processed and used to modify the program state. For more details, see the root-level documentation.
//!
//! Some of these events represent different "parts" of a traditional event-handling loop. You could
//! approximate the basic ordering loop of [`EventLoop::run(...)`] like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let mut start_cause = StartCause::Init;
//!
//! while !elwt.exiting() {
//!     event_handler(NewEvents(start_cause), elwt);
//!
//!     for e in (window events, user events, device events) {
//!         event_handler(e, elwt);
//!     }
//!
//!     for w in (redraw windows) {
//!         event_handler(RedrawRequested(w), elwt);
//!     }
//!
//!     event_handler(AboutToWait, elwt);
//!     start_cause = wait_if_necessary();
//! }
//!
//! event_handler(LoopExiting, elwt);
//! ```
//!
//! This leaves out timing details like [`ControlFlow::WaitUntil`] but hopefully
//! describes what happens in what order.
//!
