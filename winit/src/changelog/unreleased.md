The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The sections should follow the order `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`,
`Removed`, and `Fixed`.

Platform specific changed should be added to the end of the section and grouped
by platform name. Common API additions should have `, implemented` at the end
for platforms where the API was initially implemented. See the following example
on how to add them:

```md
### Added

- Add `Window::turbo()`, implemented on X11, Wayland, and Web.
- On X11, add `Window::some_rare_api`.
- On X11, add `Window::even_more_rare_api`.
- On Wayland, add `Window::common_api`.
- On Windows, add `Window::some_rare_api`.
```

When the change requires non-trivial amount of work for users to comply
with it, the migration guide should be added below the entry, like:

```md
- Deprecate `Window` creation outside of `EventLoop::run`

  This was done to simply migration in the future. Consider the
  following code:

  // Code snippet.

  To migrate it we should do X, Y, and then Z, for example:

  // Code snippet.

```

The migration guide could reference other migration examples in the current
changelog entry.

### Changed

- Bump MSRV from `1.86` to `1.88`.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- On Wayland, a window created with a parent window now calls `xdg_toplevel.set_parent` with that
  parent, and is closed together with its parent: it receives `WindowEvent::Destroyed` and no
  further events. The window stays visible until the application drops it, and so does its parent,
  which is only destroyed once all its child windows and popups have been dropped.
- On Wayland, creating a window whose parent is not a Wayland window, not a window created by the
  same event loop, or a popup now fails with `CreateWindowError::InvalidAttribute`. Previously,
  the parent was silently ignored.

### Fixed

- Fix `RgbaIcon::new` and `CustomCursorSource::from_rgba` rejecting every valid
  RGBA buffer.
- On macOS, fix text selected from the Character Viewer not producing an IME commit.
- On iOS, forward software keyboard composition and candidate commits as IME events.
- On Wayland, fix text not being copied to some application due to missing some mime types.
